        <p>fountain pen Before fountain pens were invented, if
             people wanted to write with ink they had to use a dip pen.
              Dip pens started out as simply a sharpened stick or feather.
               Eventually they became man-made metal points.
                When you hear someone refer to a dip pen, theyâ€™re referencing a metal point that is attached to a holder. 
                The pen is dipped directly into ink and only holds enough ink to write a few words.
                 Once it runs out it has to be re-dipped to get more ink.</p>
